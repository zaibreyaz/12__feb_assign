    "    Ans: When in the runtime an error that occurs after passing the syntax test is called exception.\n",
    "        For example, when we divide any number by zero then the ZeroDivisionError exception is raised, \n",
    "        or when we import a module that does not exist then ImportError is raised.\n",

    "        preventing the program from executing. Exceptions, on the other hand,  occur during runtime due to unforeseen circumstances such as invalid user input or network failures. \n",
    "        They can be handled by the program using try-catch blocks, allowing the program to continue executing rather than crashing. While syntax errors are structural, \n",

    "        For example, if a program is expecting input from a user and the user provides invalid data, the program may throw an exception. \n",

    "        and the except block is used to handle the exception. If an exception is raised in the try block, the program will jump to the except block to handle the exception.\n",
    "        Here is an example: Suppose we have a function that reads an input number from the user, but the user may enter a non-numeric value. \n",
    "        We can use a try-except block to handle this exception and ask the user to enter a valid number again. If the user enters a valid number, \n",

    "    In Python, the try statement is used to enclose code that may cause an exception, and the else statement is used to execute code if the try block doesn't raise an exception.\n",
    "    Example: If a file is present in the directory, the try block will execute the file reading operation, and if it is successful, \n",

    "    the finally block will be executed to close the file, ensuring it is not left open. But if an exception occurs during the try block, \n",
    "    the except block will handle the exception, and the finally block will still be executed to close the file.\n",
    "\n",
